# NLP downstream task training scripts and also representation of same through flask

Question Answering & fill in the missing words on BERT, BIOBERT, CLINICAL BERT, RoBERTa, BIO-MED RoBERTa, XLNET and spanish to english translation using Neural Machine Translation Model

## Dataset for Question Answering model
To use the BioASQ dataset, you need to register in the BioASQ website which authorizes the use of the dataset. Please unpack the pre-processed BioASQ dataset(factoid) provided above to a directory http://participants-area.bioasq.org/general_information/general_information_registration/

 
## Steps to Set-Up for Question Answering model

 1. For each model seperate guidlines are mentioned

## Fill in the missing word model
  Pretrained masked language models used. (BERT, BIOBERT, CLINICAL BERT, RoBERTa, BIO-MED RoBERTa, XLNET )
  
## Translation model
 data set can for any language can be downloaded from this link. http://www.manythings.org/anki/
 Training script is present with name _translation.ipynb, experiments can be done with different hyper parameter values for better result
 
## Visualization of attention head
 _VIZ.ipynb comprises attention head visualizations through BERTVIZ library. 
 
## Demo video attached
